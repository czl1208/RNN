Form I-9 Process   .An Online Training for Supervisors and Designees .Presented by .Human Resources .Revised November 2009 . 000000
Objectives .Upon completion of this training the participant will .Be able to complete a Form I-9 .Be aware of penalties associated with non-compliance .Be familiar with UA’s compliance with the IRCA .Understand what is expected of the employee .Understand the supervisor’s scope of responsibilities .Know what steps are involved to update or verify information on a Form I-9 . 000000
Background .	On November 6, 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) became law and thereby created new obligations for all employers to obtain and keep verification of each new employee’s identity and employment eligibility.   .	The intent of the Act is to gain control of the immigration process (through use of the employment process). . 000000
UA’s Compliance with IRCA .Regardless of a new employee’s nationality, the University must: .Ensure that the new employee completes Form I-9 by date of hire (on or before 1st day of employment) .Check and verify the identity and employment eligibility of the new employee within the first 3 days of the individual’s employment .Retain the original Form I-9 document for 3 years after the date the employee begins work, or 1 year after the person’s employment is terminated, whichever is later .Update or re-verify Form I-9s that contain work authorization data with expiration dates .Make all Form I-9s available for inspection by officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Labor and Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices upon request .Failure to properly complete, retain, and/or make the form available for inspection could result in civil penalties not less than $100 and up to $1,000. . 000000
Employees Covered .	All employees (full-time, part-time, regular and temporary) hired on/or after November 6, 1986 at The University of Akron, are required to have a current Form I-9 on file.   .	Individuals designated as “employee” in this training: .Faculty .Contract Professionals .Staff (classified, unclassified and bargaining unit) .Graduate Assistants .Student Employees . 000000
Form I-9 consists of three sections: .• Section 1 – Employee information and verification .• Section 2 – Employer review and verification .• Section 3 – Updating and reverification .Form I-9 . 000000
Form I-9:  Section 1 .The employee is responsible for completing Section 1. .This section of the form must be completed no later than first day of employment after the offer of employment has been accepted. .The employee must read all notices on the form, attest to his or her citizenship or immigration status, sign and date, then submit the form to the immediate supervisor or designated UA representative. . 000000
The supervisor or designee should review Section 1 to ensure that the employee has properly completed his/her portion of the form. .Alien # or Admission # and expiration date needed if third or fourth box is checked .Employee signature and date required .Form I-9:  Section 1 . 000000
Section 2 must be completed within 3 business days from the date employment begins. .Failure to fully complete this form by the 3rd day of employment will result in termination of the employee. .The employee must present to the supervisor or UA designee documents that establish his/her identity and employment authorization. .Only original documents can be accepted from the employee.  The only exception is the employee may present a certified copy of a birth certificate. .Form I-9:  Section 2 . 000000
Upon receipt of the documentation, the supervisor or designee should compare the documents to the List of Acceptable Documents to determine which establish identity and employment eligibility.   .Important -- The supervisor or UA designee is responsible for examining the document(s) presented by the new employee then filling in the required information on the form in Section 2. .	Student employees and graduate assistants should not be given the responsibility of verifying documentation or completing Form I-9s.  .Form I-9:  Section 2 . 000000
	Compare the documents to the Lists of Acceptable Documents to determine which establish identity and employment eligibility.   .Form I-9:  Section 2 .SAMPLE .SAMPLE . 000000
Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) they will accept from a new employee.   .Employers CANNOT refuse to accept a document(s) that reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to the person presenting the document(s).  To do so could be an unfair immigration-related employment practice. .Information from the document(s) must be written onto the I-9 Form.  Do NOT attach copies for Human Resources to complete Section 2. .Form I-9:  Section 2 . 000000
Ensure that document title, issuing authority and document # are recorded in the appropriate spaces.  .Do not use white out on the form!  If you make a mistake, cross out the error, date it and initial it. .Form I-9:  Section 2 . 000000
Re-verification of Form I-9 .	If the employee’s work authorization is approaching expiration, he or she will need to re-verify employment eligibility by providing additional documentation. .	An HR Representative will contact the employee prior to the employee’s expired work authorization date to set up a date and time for the employee to re-verify information.   .	 . 000000
Re-verification versus New Form .Re-verification:  refers to reconfirming an employee’s proof of extended work authorization using a previously completed form. .Also complete part A. if name has changed at the time form is being re-verified. . 000000
Re-verification versus New Form . A New Form I-9 will need to be completed by . the employee if one or more of the following  . situations occur: .The employee changes employment status (i.e., student assistant to full-time staff employee, graduate assistant to part-time faculty, etc.)  Call Megan Richardson at x4910  if you have questions.  .The original Form I-9 on file in Human Resources was previously re-verified. .	 . 000000
Where to Obtain a Blank Form .Paper Copy –  .It is the University of Akron’s practice to include a copy of Form I-9, Lists of Acceptable Documents, and Instruction sheet as part of the “offer letter packet” sent to faculty, contract professionals and staff employees.    .Electronic Version –  .on Human Resources’ web site at http://www.uakron.edu/hr/HRInfoServs.php  .as part of the Online Employee Orientation Packet for part-time employees at http://www.uakron.edu/hr/ptpackets.php  . 000000
Distribution & Filing Requirements .	It is the responsibility of the immediate supervisor or designee to ensure that the original Form I-9 is forwarded to the appropriate department for filing. . 000000
Faculty, Staff, and Contract Professionals:  .	Form I-9s must be forwarded to Human Resources Information Services for filing and maintaining.   .Campus Mail:  Human Resources +4730 .Hand Deliver:  HR, Administrative Services Building  .			        Room 130  .For questions contact: (330) 972-4910 .  Distribution & Filing Requirements . 000000
 Graduate Assistants: .	Completed original Form I-9s must be attached to the Acceptance Agreement and Appointment Form then forwarded to the Graduate School for filing and maintaining. .Student Employees: .	Completed original Form I-9s must be attached to the Student Employment Form then forwarded to the Student Employment Office for filing and maintaining. .	 .Distribution & Filing Requirements . 000000
About E-Verify .WHAT IS IT? .E-verify is a free internet system that compares information contained on the Form I-9 with records contained in the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) databases to help employers verify the identity and employment eligibility of newly hired employees. .WHO IS AFFECTED? .Institutions of higher education are required to cover only those employees directly working on federal contracts to determine if the employees are authorized to legally work in the United States.   This includes both new and existing employees directly working on federal contracts.   .CAN AN EMPLOYEE WORK DURING THE E-VERIFY PROCESS? .Affected employees are permitted to work during the E-Verify process. . 000000
E-Verify:  The Process .HOW DOES THE PROCESS WORK AT UA? .The Office of Research Services & Sponsored Programs will email Human Resources Information Services (HRIS) a “Notice of Award” form noting that E-Verification is required. .The Principal Investigator/Project Director will:  .forward names of the affected individuals to HRIS. .refer all new and existing employees directly working on a federal contract to HRIS.  .New employees will complete the Form I-9 in the presence of an HRIS representative within 3 days of employment. .Existing employees assigned to the contract will be verified within 90 days of the award date of the contract. .An HR Representative will access the E-Verify system  to verify employment eligibility of the new and existing employees assigned to the contract. .WHAT IF E-Verify RESULTS SHOW A NON-CONFIRMATION? .An employee who does not appeal a “non-confirmation” notice from the E-Verification results will be subject to immediate termination of employment. . 000000

2 .Say a variable has mean 36,500 and standard deviation 5000. .What is the probability of getting the value 37,700 or less? .Using the z table we first need to calculate z from the x = 37700. .So z = (37700 – 36500)/5000 = 0.24  which is only 2 decimal places.  If it was more you would round the z to 2 decimals.  .Now in the table a z =.24 has a value .5948 – what does this mean?  This means the probability of having a z of .24 or less is .5948.  So, the table works with the probability of a value or less. .What if you wanted to the probability of 37,700 or more?  Since the whole distribution adds up to a probability of 1, to get the prob of 37700 or more take 1 minus the prob of 37700 or less.  .37700 .In the table .To get this area (probability) take 1 minus tabled value .

Note that half the area is to the left of 0. .On the left side we want Zl.  From 0 all the way back on the left we have area = .5.   The table deals with areas to the left of a value.

If it was discrete we would go to 44, but since it is continuous we would miss all the values from 43 to 44. .We have to translate the X of 43 to a Z.  Z = (43-50)/4 = -7/4 = -1.75.  In the table with a Z = -1.75 we get the area to the left as .0401.  But, we want the area to the right.  So P(X > 43) = 1 - .0401 = .9599 .I did’t draw in the normal curve here.

Capacitors in Parallel .Let’s look first at hooking up two identical parallel plate capacitors in parallel: that means the wires from the two top plates are joined, similarly at the bottom, so effectively they become one capacitor. .What is its capacitance? From the picture, the combined capacitor has twice the area of plates, the same distance apart. .We see that  C = C1 + C2 .a . EEECE1
       Capacitors in Parallel .If two capacitors C1, C2 are wired together as shown they have the same voltage V between plates.  .Hence they hold charges Q1 = C1V, Q2 = C2V, for total charge Q = Q1 + Q2 = (C1 + C2)V = CV. .So capacitors in parallel just add:  .C = C1 + C2 + C3 + … .C1 .C2 . EEECE1
Capacitors in Series .Regarding the above as a single capacitor, the important thing to realize is that in adding charge via the outside end wires, no charge is added to the central section labeled A: it’s isolated by the gaps between the plates. .Charge Q on the outside plate of C1 will attract –Q to the other plate, this has to come from C2, as shown. .Series capacitors all hold the same charge. .Q .Q .-Q .-Q .A .C2 .C1 . EEECE1
Capacitors in Series .Series capacitors all hold the same charge. .The voltage drop V1 across C1 is V1 = Q/C1. .The voltage drop across C2 is V2 =Q/C2. .Denoting the total capacitance of the two taken together as C, then the total voltage drop is V = Q/C. .But V = V1 + V2, so Q/C = Q/C1 + Q/C2, .Q .Q .-Q .-Q .A .C2 .C1 .Important! . EEECE1
It Takes Work to Charge a Capacitor .Suppose a sphere capacitor C already contains charge q.  Then it’s at a potential V(q) = q/C. .To bring a further little charge dq from far away, against the repulsive force of the charge already there, takes work V(q)dq. .So, to deliver a total charge Q to the capacitor, one bit dq at a time, takes total work: . EEECE1
Work Done in Charging a Parallel Plate Capacitor .The math is identical to charging a sphere by bringing up little charges from far away (see the last slide) but for the parallel plate capacitor we only have to bring charge across from one plate to another:  the work is still V(q)dq for each dq.  .A capacitor is actually charged, of course, by using a battery to pump charge from one plate to the other via an outside wire, but the route taken doesn’t affect the gain in potential energy of the charge transferred. .q .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ .+ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ ._ .dq .q .-q .V(q) = q/C . EEECE1
Energy Stored in a Capacitor .The work needed to place charge in a capacitor is stored as electrostatic potential energy in the capacitor: .We proved the first, the others come from V = Q/C. . EEECE1
Clicker Question .How much work does it take to put charge Q on to a 2mF capacitor compared with putting the  same charge on to a 1mF capacitor? .Twice as much .The same .Half as much . EEECE1
Clicker Answer .How much work does it take to put charge Q on to a 2mF capacitor compared with putting the  same charge on to a 1mF capacitor? .Half as much: the 2mF capacitor is only at half the voltage of the 1mF capacitor if they have the same charge q, so bringing up extra charge dq takes only half the work. . EEECE1
Pulling the Plates Apart .Suppose we have charge Q on a parallel plate capacitor having area A and plate separation d. .We now pull the plates to a greater distance apart, say 2d. .Assume first that the capacitor is disconnected from the battery, so no charge can flow. .Since the plates are oppositely charged, it takes work to pull them apart. .a .

Field for Two Oppositely Charged Planes .a .+ .= .Superpose the field lines from the negatively charged plate on the parallel positively charged one, and you’ll see the total field is double in the space between the plates, but exactly zero outside the plates. .Reminder from lecture 3 . EEECE1
Working to Pull the Plates Apart .From the last slide, the electric field    E = /0 between the plates is /20  from the top plate and /20 from the bottom plate. .Therefore, in finding the work done against the electric field in moving the top plate, charge Q, we can only count the field from the bottom plate—a charge can’t do work moving in its own field! .a . EEECE1
Working to Pull the Plates Apart .Moving the top plate, charge Q = A, a distance x outwards in the electric field /20 from the bottom plate takes work .Now initially                 , finally .so work done = capacitor energy change: .a .a .x . EEECE1
Working to Pull the Plates Apart .Moving the top plate, charge Q, a distance x outwards created an extra volume V  = Ax between the plates, filled with the constant electric field E, and took work: .                              .The electric field itself is the store of energy: and this is true in general, for varying as well as constant fields, the energy density in an electric field is                .a .x .

Puzzle… .Pulling the plates apart takes external work, since the plates are oppositely charged and attract each other. .Yet after pulling them to double the initial separation, there is less energy stored in the capacitor than before! .What about conservation of energy? .a .V .V . EEECE1
Puzzle Answer .What about conservation of energy? .The capacitance goes down, the voltage is constant, so charge flows from the capacitance into the battery.  (Q = CV) .And, it flows the wrong way—against the battery’s potential, so this takes work.  The battery is being charged, it’s storing energy. .a .V .V . EEECE1
Field Energy for a Charged Sphere .For a charged spherical conductor of radius R: .The energy stored in the electric field is .and this is just         ,   so the capacitor’s energy is in the electric field.   . EEECE1
How Big is an Electron? .We’ve just seen that a charge Q on a sphere of radius R has electric field energy  .This means that since the electron has a charge,         if the inverse square law holds up at smaller and smaller distances, it can’t be infinitely small! .A lower limit on its size is given by assuming its mass comes entirely from this electrostatic energy, using   U = E = mc2.   .This gives R about 10-15m: called the classical radius of the electron.  In fact, at this R, Coulomb’s law breaks down—and we need quantum mechanics. . EEECE1
Dielectrics .If a nonconducting material is placed in an electric field, the electrons will still move a little, remaining within their home molecules or atoms, which will therefore become polar. .The overall effect of this polarization is to generate a layer of positive charge on the right and negative charge on the left. .a .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .+ ._ .
